# RED Starter

A WordPress starter theme for RED Academy students, forked from Underscores.

## Installation

### 1. Download me (don't clone me!)

Then add me to your `wp-content` directory.

### 2. Rename the `redstarter-master` directory

Make sure that the theme directory name is project appropriate!

### 3. Install the dev dependencies

Next you'll need to run `npm install` **inside your theme directory** next to install the node modules you'll need for Gulp, etc.

### 4. Update the proxy in `gulpfile.js`

Lastly, be sure to update your `gulpfile.js` with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy (so change `localhost[:port-here]/[your-dir-name-here]` to the appropriate localhost URL).

Project Overview
- required to recreate inhabitent website via wordpress core.

Project Outcome
- successfully recreated identical site with functionality and content that can be updated via client.

Project Difficulties
- very slow process to undestand the components of wordpress core and implement php programing.
- eventually learned proper taxonomies and wordpress functions to implement inhabitent site.
- experienced equipment failure near project deadline and was delayed. as a result was unable to complete styling for 4 pages including the main journal page, the individual journal pages, the individual adventure pages and find us page. physically did not have the nessecary time to fully complete project despite 2 day extension. without equipment failure would have most definitely been able to finnish styling.
- found it quite innificient to work with premade scss stylesheets as there were many existing styles that I was unfamiliar with. this caused alot of restyling and a lack of organization. in future would prefer premade stylesheets without any premade code. this would aid with accurate organization and efficient modularity.

Project Conclusion
- with more time would have perfected some details related to modularity in styling.
- learned some invaluable web development skills which I plan to continue exercising.
